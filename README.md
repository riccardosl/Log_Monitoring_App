# Log analysis dashboard

## Objective

The application is build using Node.js, a modern runtime environment for JavaScript. It is capable of high performance and often use for real time applications.
The end user of the application is the IT staff, during their activities they might want to collect some log evidence of suspicious traffic on the network. The application will parse the collected data in a better readable format on a web browser.
At the moment the application is in a prototype state, with limited functionalities, however we are planning to add some customization and improvement.
In the future we would like to add two new additional modules, a chat functionality that will allow the IT staff to open a log event and consult with a dedicated security consultant.
